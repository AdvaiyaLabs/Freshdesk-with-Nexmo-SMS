## Introduction

With Freshdesk, organization can set, manage, and meet customer expectations by providing consistent support service. The support team members can choose to get notified via email every time a ticket gets assigned to them. But as they gets lots of emails, it becomes a challenge to quickly identify critical emails and proactively respond and take prompt actions for critical customer queries.

For all urgent actionable items, email notification cannot be an effective medium, especially in case of providing helpdesk service. Any delay on the customer query impacts customer engagement and may result in a lost customer.

Over the past years, mobile has become the most impactful communication platform due to its massive adoption rate. And thus, Short Messaging Service (SMS) becomes an effective communication channel to deliver business-critical information in short timeframe to respective team members. SMS empowers support team members to stay on the top of the things that matter and allow them to proactively respond to customers.

Freshdesk with Nexmo SMS allows organization to facilitate proactive customer support service by enabling their support team to get notified through the SMS delivered for all the critical customer support tickets.
